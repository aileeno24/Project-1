  <h2>Why are cats are your best friend?</h2>
<p> Cats are very independent animals that do not need the same attention as other house pets.
  Unlike dogs, they do not need to be rubbed and played with. If you are a busy person that is never home,
  your cat won't miss you. You won't need to feel guilty when you are gone for too long. Also, they very
  easily learn how to use the litterbox, so training isn't too difficult. If this isn't a plus, I don't
  know what is. Finally, you can't forget how adorable they are!</p>
